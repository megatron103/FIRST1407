I could say I never dare
To think about you in that way
But, I would be lying
And I pretend I'm happy for you
When you find some dude to take home
But I won't deny that.

In the midst of the crowds
In the shapes, in the clouds
I don't see nobody but you
In my rose-tinted dreams
Wrinkled silk on my sheets
I don't see nobody but you

Boy, you got me hooked onto somethin'
Who could say that they saw us comin'?
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams
Tell me, do you feel the love?
